# MatLib
A little (fake) C++ library that is basically the the C++ standard library. 

I am not making this for use, but more just for learning about the lower level and advanced C++ concepts.

This library is made up for a few modules:

#Containers

* Linked_List is a ... linked list.

* Vector is a array list or dynamically sized array
